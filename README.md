## Prerequisites

If you do not have Gatsby Cli installed yet, do it first.

```text
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

More information on [GatsbyJS.org](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-one)

## Getting started

Install the starter using Gatsby Cli `gatsby new` command.

```

Go into the newly created directory and run

```text
gatsby develop
```

to hot-serve your website on http://localhost:8000 or

```text
gatsby build
```

to create static site ready to host (/public).

##### External services

The starter uses external services for some functions: comments, searching, analytics. To use them you have to secure some access data. All services are free to use or have generous free tiers big enough for a personal blog.

Create an `.env` file like below in the root folder. Change `...` placeholders with real data.
<br />By default, your `.env` file will be ignored by git. Remove `.env` from `.gitignore` in order to be able to push the file to your repository.

```text
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=...
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=...
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=...
FB_APP_ID=...
```
